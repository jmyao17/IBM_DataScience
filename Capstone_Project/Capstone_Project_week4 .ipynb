    "Let's say one of my friends plans to initialize an after-school program for elementary school students and middle-school students. He came to me and asked me for the suggestion on the location of the after-school program.\n",
    "In order to provide sound advice for him, we should consider the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- distance between the location of the after-school program and the public schools.\n",
    "- number of schools nearby.\n",
    "- number of other existing after-school programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitely, the travel cost from the schools to the after-school site is positively correlated to the distance between them. Moreover, there is a high probability that the more schools around the after-school site, the more students will enroll the after school program. But one should also check if there already exist other after-school programs in the neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Introduction to the data and methodoloy \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we should collect the data of schools,  number of other existing after-school programs, and the density of the schools in the neighbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The packages that we are going to use include (but not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "- requests\n",
    "- folium\n",
    "- Nominatim\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "as well as foursquare API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say my friend is also living in Lansing Capital Area, Michigan State. The procedure of preparing the data can be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- download postal code from website, such as http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us \n",
    "- add the information of the latitude and longitude if not available by using the get_latlon() function defined below\n",
    "- use Foursquare API to get all the venues in the Lansing Capital Area.\n",
    "- filtered out all the venues with the category of something like \"school\"\n",
    "- visualize the location of the schools with folium.Map\n",
    "- use the groupby method to sort the number of schools in each neighbourhoods\n",
    "- find out the number of existing after-school programs in each neighbourhoods\n",
    "- calculate the ratio of schools to after-school programs and use this ratio as a guideline \n"
