    "Let's say one of my friends plans to initialize an after-school program for elementary-school students and middle-school students. He came to me and asked me for suggestion on the location of the after-school program.\n",
    "In order to provide a sound advice for him, we should consider the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- distance between the location of the after-school program and the public schools.\n",
    "- number of schools nearby.\n",
    "- number of other existing after-school programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitely, the travel cost from the public schoold to the after-school site is postively correlated to the distance between them. Moreover, there is a high probability that the more schools around the after-school site, the more students will enroll the after school program. But one should also check if there already exist other after-school programs in the neighbourhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Introduction to the data and methodoloy \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we should collect the data of schools,  number of other existing after-school programs, and the density of the schools in the neighbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The packages that we are going to use include (but not limited to):\n",

    "- pandas\n",
